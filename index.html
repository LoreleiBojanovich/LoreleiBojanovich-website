        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently an undergraduate junior majoring in psychology at the University of California, Riverside. I decided to major in psychology because I was always entertained by my psychology classes, and even when classes got more difficult, my passion for learning about psychology fueled me to keep on going. I believe that my interest in psychology comes from the fact that everything we are taught applies to everyone's life in some shape or form. For example, when we learn about our brain functions and how they relate to each one of our behaviors, whether it be hearing or laughing. In addition, I have always liked to help my friends through their problems by listening to them and then coming up with a solution to help them. <br><br>

        My goal is to become a marriage family therapist with an emphasis on family therapy involving children ages 1 to 17. I want to focus mainly on children and their family problems because I am a firm believer that if we are equipped with the right tools early on, we will have a better future. Some ways that I have started to prepare for my future is by taking up volunteer, leadership, and childcare opportunities. I began by starting my own babysitting company, where I took care of 10 children, some weekly, others whenever the parents had plans. Babysitting helped me not only gain experience with taking care of children and making them feel safe but also helped me manage my time and communicate with adults about things concerning their kids. Whenever I was not working taking care of kids, I would volunteer at my local animal shelter, where children on the autism spectrum would come to play with either the cats or dogs. This volunteering experience helped me interact with children on the autism spectrum and see how playing with pets of their choice helped them feel more comfortable. Finally, I became the president of a volunteering club called Rotary. This club helped me become more confident and also gave me more opportunities to solve problems between people disagreeing on things. I was also able to practice my professionalism through emails, meetings, and presentations. <br><br>

        While I have had the privilege to do all of this and learn many things that will be able to help me with my professional future, I still believe that I need work experience in the psychology field. For that reason, I am looking for and applying to internships that have to do with psychology. One internship that I received was helping out at an applied behavior analysis clinic in Peru. Since the laws in Peru are different from the laws in the United States, I was able to sit in on therapy sessions and even help treat one of the patients through play therapy. Unfortunately, this internship did not last too long as I need to go back to the United States for school. I hope that I will be able to find an internship similar to this near me so I can do it throughout the summer.
